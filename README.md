# Stamp

Stamp is a command line note-taking software for POSIX compatible systems. At the moment it's tested on GNU/Linux and on FreeBSD, but it should be very portable for other platforms. Stamp also works 
under Windows native or Cygwin, but it's not actively tested under it. It is forked from [Memo] by Niko Rosvall at version 1.4. The main difference being that Stamp supports categories and Memo focusses on status of notes, like todo's. Stamp is inspired by [Stampnote] for OSX.

## Example usage
```sh
$ stamp -a movies "Cloudy with a chance of meatballs"
$ stamp -s movies
1   2014-12-01  Cloudy with a chance of meatballs.
```
