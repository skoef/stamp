Postponed notes are not shown by default. Postponed note
can be marked as undone or done normally using -m or -M flag.
Only undone notes can be postponed.
.PP
It's possible to change the location (and name) of the .memo
file. Create $HOME/.memorc with a line MEMO_PATH=/path/you/would/like
, Memo will use that path instead of the default $HOME/.memo path.
.PP
It's also possible to set memo path using an environment variable.
For example: export MEMO_PATH=/path/to/some/file. If MEMO_PATH
environment variable is set that will be used. If it's not set,
Memo will try to read $HOME/.memorc. If the file does not exist
or has errors, Memo will use $HOME/.memo file to store the notes.
.PP
Since version 1.3 -D option asks for confirmation before deleting all
notes. It's possible to disable this confirmation via ~/.memorc
property. To disable the confirmation add MEMO_CONFIRM_DELETE=no to
~/.memorc file.
